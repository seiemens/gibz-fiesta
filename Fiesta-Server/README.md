# FIEÅšTA-BACKEND
## Setup & Configuration
In case of compiler errors, ensure that the current rust branch is `nightly`.
To switch, use `rustup override set nightly`.
### Dependencies
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) & RustUp (Installed per Default)
- [rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/)
### Setup
Install Rust, navigate to git Repo, run `cargo run`. Enjoy!
### Config
Configurations to the Server (e.g. Ports and IP's) can be made in `Rocket.toml`. `.env` File needed!

## Structure
### `api`
Contains all files related to the API endpoints & routes.

### `data`
Contains all files related to Data interaction such as the `mongo_connector`.

### `helpers`
Contains small "helper" functions such as token generation & encryption. Those have been put into separate files due to the lazyness of the backend dev.

### `models`
Contains the Database Models, currently 2: `Skill` & `User`.


## Endpoints
